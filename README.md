This provides a weather radar for 3 distances around London Ontario Canada. It is intended to provide an easy desk reference for severe weather especially in summer and winter seasons. The 400km distance will show incoming weather for parts of southern Ontario: Lake Huron and Lake Erie while 100km will show the southwestern Ontario penninsular and 50km will cover just the greater London area. Note that these distances are chosen as in this region weather is usually west-to-east motion.

It uses OpenWeather as the data source mostly as Environment Canada has become more difficult to use directly in recent years.

Double touch at lower right corner will dim/undim the screen. Touch elsewhere will change the zoom level.
